# Supervised-Tree-Project

This project is a final project supervised project of Python for Machine Learning Data Science Master Class.
# The Challenge
Aim of the project is to predict Churn column. Churn covers essential information for the company. 
# Data Information
The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for  phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
